Weather or Not?
===============

This application allows a user to input a location as a city name and returns a
summary of the current weather for that city, or _not_. The app runs in the
browser using javascript and contacts an external weather API with ajax.

The app is hosted on [github][1] and can used with any modern browser [here][2].
Try it out.
